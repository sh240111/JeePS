        <p class="blog4-intro">
          Jeepneys are the most affordable form of mass transit, but unclear routes often make commuting stressful.
          This website was created to make daily travel easier by providing clear and accessible jeepney routes that
          commuters can check on their phones with just a tap.
        </p>

        <p class="blog4-intro">
          JeePS envisions a future where mass transit is not only affordable but also easy to understand. Through our
          jeepney stop and route guide, commuters in Zamboanga City can easily locate the “Kings of the Road” and know
          which jeepney to ride depending on their destination without the fear of getting lost.

            “An affordable ride is all I need to get around the city. I often hear people say they only spend less than
            20 pesos riding jeepneys, which makes me want to try it too. But as someone who has only lived in Zamboanga City
            for two years, I’ve always been hesitant because I don’t know the routes and I’m scared of losing my way home.
            With JeePS, I finally feel confident enough to give jeepney commuting a try.”

            “Since I’m from Lunzuran, I’m used to taking the Veterans route whenever I commute. One day, I decided to try the IBT jeepney,
            not realizing it takes a different path that goes around the boulevard. When we reached Garden Orchid, I panicked—I didn’t know
            the area at all. So instead of staying on the jeepney, I got off and took a piaggio to town. Looking back, I realize I could
            have just stayed on the jeepney, which was heading to the same place, but at the time, the unfamiliar route felt confusing.
            With a guide like JeePS, I wouldn’t have had to worry about getting lost.”

            “One time I lined up for a jeepney around 6 p.m., and it was already super crowded. I ended up sitting on the floor because
            all the seats were taken. Every time someone got off, I tried to take the seat, but someone else always got there first.
            By the time I finally thought I could sit comfortably, we had already reached my stop! My tip? Sometimes it’s better to wait
            for the next jeep so you can ride comfortably. With a GPS-based guide like JeePS, commuters could plan ahead, check jeepney
            locations, predict when one will arrive, and choose a less crowded ride. This way, you don’t have to scramble for a seat,
            and your travel becomes more relaxed and efficient.”

            “I rode a jeepney to Jollibee, thinking it was too far to walk. But when I got there, I realized it was actually really close
            and I could’ve just walked and saved my fare. I felt like I totally wasted my money! That’s why having something like JeePS
            would be so helpful. If I could check the route and distance on my phone beforehand, I could decide whether it’s worth riding
            the jeepney or just walking. It makes commuting smarter, saves money, and helps avoid unnecessary trips.”

          These stories of confusion, crowded rides and unnecessary trips show just how stressful and challenging commuting can be in
          Zamboanga City. With JeePS helping bridge this gap by giving commuters a clear route information and nearby jeepney stops,
          all accessible on their phones, passengers can commute wiser and ride with confidence whenever they want and wherever they are.
